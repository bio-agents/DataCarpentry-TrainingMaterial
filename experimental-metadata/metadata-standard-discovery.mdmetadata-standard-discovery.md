title: "Discovery of Metadata Standards and Databases"
---



We have explored the importance and categories of metadata standards. But, as a researcher, how do you know what metadata standards are relevant to your research? And what public databases support storing data described by the relevant metadata standards?

The [BioSharing initiative](http://www.biosharing.org) was created to support these and other query cases.

BioSharing was built upon the *Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations (MIBBI)* portal in 2009. 

BioSharing is a community resource that maps the landscape of community-developed standards in the life sciences, broadly covering biological, natural and biomedical sciences. It includes three interlinked registries:

1. [BioSharing Data Policies Registry](http://biosharing.org/policies)
2. [BioSharing Data Standards Registry](http://biosharing.org/standards/)
3. [BioSharing Databases Registry](http://biosharing.org/biodbcore/)



## User stories and query cases ##

1. [Find all the standards and databases relevant for transcriptomics experiments/data](http://biosharing.org/search/?q=transcriptomics)
2. [Find all the standards and databases relevant for microarray technology](http://biosharing.org/search/?q=microarray)
3. [I use high-througput sequencing technologies, which are the relavant standards and databases for my research?](http://biosharing.org/search/?q=high-throuput+sequencing)
